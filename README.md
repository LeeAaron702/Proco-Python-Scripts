# Proco-Python-Scripts
Collection of python scripts that I have written for Professor Color to speed up data processing or data analysis

# Overview
This repository contains two Python scripts developed to assist in data processing for the Professor Color website, as part of an effort to improve the website's SEO score. The scripts automate the process of managing product data, reducing manual effort and minimizing errors.

## Scripts
SEO.py: This script is designed to process product data from a CSV file and generate additional product information that is essential for SEO optimization. It utilizes the OpenAI API to generate SEO-friendly product titles based on a set of predefined rules and a reference CSV file to validate product capacities. The script categorizes products, extracts relevant details from product names (such as machine type, SKU, color, and capacity), and generates tags, SEO page titles, and descriptions for each product.

Shopify-all-products-api-fetch.py: This script fetches the entire product catalog from a Shopify store using the Shopify API and exports the product title, ID, and variant SKU to a CSV file. This data is crucial for inventory management and website maintenance.

Conclusion
These scripts are part of a larger effort to optimize the Professor Color website for search engines, improve the online shopping experience, and streamline the management of product data. By automating these processes, we can ensure the accuracy and consistency of our product data, ultimately leading to a better user experience and higher SEO rankings.
